# cprogress
progress bar for c

A couple of small C libraries for a progress bar. The ANSI one is working, although I still need to deal with the case where the length of the message is too long for the progress bar window.

The ncurses one is mostly working. It used to work, but I made changes to it, and then decided to just implement my new ideas in the ANSI version instead.
